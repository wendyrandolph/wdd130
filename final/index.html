            I'm guessing if you are reading this, that you recently have lost a spouse, you know someone who has, 
          or someone who's about to find themself in this situation.  It's a difficult place that no one really wants to 
          find themself in. Although this may be geared towards people of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, I hope 
          that there will be helpful material for all.

            It's a task that takes a lot of work and a lot of effort to go from shattered, to feeling whole again.  
            Life isn't ever going to be quite the same but with time and work you can experience a full life again. You'll 
            laugh, you'll have fun, you'll find yourself happy.

         Everyone who finds themself in this position, will feel a gamut of emotions everyday, and multiple times a day even.  
         When I first started my widow journey I didn't know much about anything.  So take a browse and look for book suggestions, quotes to 
         uplift and inspire you.  And other resources you might find handy.
