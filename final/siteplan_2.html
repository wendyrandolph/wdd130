      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        To help those who find themselves in the role of being a widow or a
        widower, and really want to find an easy, <br />
        access to resources such as books, movies, talks, quotes and other
        resources that will help navigate through <br />
        the grieving process especially in those early days.
      </p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        Any man or woman who finds themselves a widow or widower and has zero
        idea of what to do, or what might help in their new life.

      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <h4>Heading Font: Oswald</h4>
      <p class="heading">
        Easy to read, and draws attention, but also pairs well with the
        Roboto-Slab.
      </p>
      <h4>Paragraph Font: Lato</h4>
      <p>
        I like the light weight on this font, and how it draws interest into
        wanting to see what is being said.
      </p>
      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>
        We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to
        temple service and accomodations. Our shuttle runs to meet the endowment
        schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe
        alternative for your family.
      </p>
      <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as
        you transition from traveling to the temple to actually entering the
        temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and freshing up in
        order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.
